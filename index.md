# Hello World

Welcome to my home page! My name is **Lyuzhi Liu**, and I am a student at
[California State University, Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/). I am
currently taking **CPSC 120L**.

This website is my portfolio for the course. Here, I will share a few projects
I completed this semester and reflect on what I learned.

### CPSC 120

Throughout this semester, I worked on several labs that helped me learn the
fundamentals of programming — such as variables, arithmetic, input and output,
conditionals, loops, and writing functions. Below are two of my favorite labs.

* **Lab 6 – Blackjack Hand Calculator**

    Lab 6 was one of my favorite labs because it felt like building part of a
    real game. I learned how to use functions to break a larger problem into
    smaller steps and how to use conditionals to correctly calculate the value
    of a Blackjack hand. After completing it, I felt much more confident in
    using functions and organizing code.

* **Lab 11 – ASCII Art**

    Today’s Lab 11 was also one of my favorites. It was fun to create shapes
    and patterns using loops and characters. This lab helped me understand how
    nested loops work, and it made programming feel creative and enjoyable. I
    liked seeing how simple code could draw something visually interesting.

## Looking forward

CPSC 120 gave me a strong foundation in programming and helped me become more
comfortable using tools such as VS Code, Terminal, Git, and Linux. I learned
how to read error messages, debug my code, and break down problems into smaller
pieces. I am excited to continue learning more about computer science and build
more complex projects in the future.
